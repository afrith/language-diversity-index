# Linguistic diversity index

This repository contains the SQL code used to calculate the linguistic diversity index data used to produce the map below.
More details in [my blog post](https://adrianfrith.com/linguistic-diversity/).
To run it you will need to download the following data files:

* [`south-africa.zip`](https://stuff.adrianfrith.com/south-africa.zip): shapefile of South Africa
* [`SAL_APRI.zip`](https://stuff.adrianfrith.com/SAL_APRI.zip): shapefile of "small areas" from Census 2011
* [`sal-lang.csv`](https://stuff.adrianfrith.com/sal-lang.csv): language statistics for the small areas
